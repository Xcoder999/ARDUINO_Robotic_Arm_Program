# ARDUINO_Robotic_Arm_Program
This is my second robotic arm project, but with Arduino. It's build up with 5 Micro Servo 9g motors, and can be control with an IRemote. 
Note: If you were using an Arduino U3 Board or older, you might need to download an older version of the IRremote library, else it would not work.
This is my circut design made in Tinkercad:
